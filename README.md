# KH Meetings Schedules Assistant

### How Can This Application Help You
This project aims to shorten the time OCLM Overseers spend preparing OCLM Schedules and managing assignments. It also offers flexibility during weeks of circuit overseers' visits, which affect some parts of the meetings, and during assembly weeks when there are no midweek meetings.


### Support and Contribution 
This project aims to support new, essential features and a wide range of meeting languages. We warmly welcome contributions from other JW developers! To get involved, please contact the developer at *jeztan12@gmail.com*.

### Privacy and Security
Publisher names and other information entered by users are not sent to cloud storage. This data is stored on their local devices.  Using the same congregation on different devices will not display the same content, just like how the JW Library app keeps the data.

## What's New
### October 15, 2025
âœ¨ You can now add Local Needs parts even if theyâ€™re not in the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook.
<br>
âœ¨ You can also adjust part durations to abbreviate other scheduled parts in Living as Christians

ðŸ“– The body of elders is responsible for determining whether to address an urgent local need, even if a local needs part is not scheduled in the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook. In such cases, the Life and Ministry Meeting overseer should arrange for one or more scheduled parts to be abbreviated. (sfg 4:18.2)

ðŸ’¡ You can also use this feature when Governing Body updates are scheduled during a week without a Local Needs part in the workbook.

### October 14, 2025
âœ¨ Students already assigned to a student part for the week will now be automatically hidden from the assignment selector in other parts.
This helps prevent assigning the same student to multiple parts within the same week.
