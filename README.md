# KH Meetings Schedules Assistant

### How Can This Application Help You
This project aims to shorten the time OCLM Overseers spend preparing OCLM Schedules and managing assignments. It also offers flexibility during weeks of circuit overseers' visits, which affect some parts of the meetings, and during assembly weeks when there are no midweek meetings.


### Support and Contribution 
This project aims to support new, essential features and a wide range of meeting languages. We warmly welcome contributions from other JW developers! To get involved, please contact the developer at *jeztan12@gmail.com*.

### Privacy and Security
